# Retrospective - Epic 2: Mobile-First Layout & Navigation

**Date:** December 26, 2025
**Participants:** Opsa (Project Lead), Bob (Scrum Master), Alice (Product Owner), Charlie (Senior Dev), Dana (QA Engineer), Elena (Junior Dev)

## 📊 Epic Summary

**Epic Goal:** Transform the core site structure and navigation to be fully responsive and usable on touchscreen devices, ensuring legibility and accessibility conform to mobile standards.

**Delivery Metrics:**
- **Status:** Complete (3/3 Stories)
- **Velocity:** High (Completed efficiently with no major blockers)
- **Quality:** 100% Visual Regression Pass (Desktop), 0 Production Incidents

**Key Achievements:**
- Successfully implemented **mobile-first architecture** while maintaining **0% desktop regression**.
- Pivot to **"poetic-creponne" design** for Hero section executed smoothly.
- Migrated legacy CSS to a robust **Global Variable System** (no Tailwind).
- **AI Code Reviews** proved critical in catching accessibility and token consistency issues.

## 🛑 Challenges & Lessons Learned

| Challenge | Impact | Lesson Learned |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CSS Migration Complexity** | Legacy `clamp()` values and specificities required extra time to map correctly. | **Explicit Documentation**: Documenting the font-stack and token hierarchy upfront prevents circular reference bugs. |
| **Visual Snapshot Churn** | Mobile baselines required frequent updates as design adapted (e.g., hamburger menu). | **Protocol Needed**: We need a clear process for *when* to update snapshots to avoid "blindly updating" vs. "catching regressions." |
| **Fidelity vs. Usability** | Strict desktop match vs. mobile usability (e.g., nav menu) required distinct NFRs. | **Explicit ACs**: Defining separate NFRs (Visual Fidelity for Desktop, Usability for Mobile) is the winning pattern. |

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Visual Fidelity NFRs Work**: The "0% Desktop Regression" rule was not just a constraint but a quality gate that forced discipline.
2. **AI as Safety Net**: AI reviews consistently caught "invisible" debt (missing aria attributes, correct token usage) that human reviewers might miss in speed.
3. **Design Intelligence**: Including "Design Intelligence" tables in stories (mapping legacy tokens to new variables) minimized developer guesswork.

## 📝 Action Items

### Process Improvements
- [ ] **Define Snapshot Update Protocol** (Owner: Dana, Due: Before Epic 3) - Document when to update mobile baselines.
- [ ] **Update Architecture Docs** (Owner: Paige/Charlie, Due: End of Week) - Add "Global CSS & Font Strategy" section.

### Technical Debt
- [ ] **Refactor Magic Numbers** (Owner: Elena, Priority: Low) - Scan codebase for any remaining hardcoded values missed in Story 2.1.

## 🚀 Epic 3 Preparation (High-Performance Asset Delivery)

**Critical Path (Must be done before Epic 3 Kickoff):**
1.  **Research Image Placeholder Strategy** (Owner: Charlie, Est: 2h)
    *   *Goal:* Decide on library/approach (e.g., `plaiceholder`) for generating blur-up data to meet FR6.
2.  **Setup Lighthouse CI Baseline** (Owner: Dana, Est: 3h)
    *   *Goal:* Configure tooling to measure LCP/CLS automatically.

**Parallel Tasks:**
-   **Audit `useScrollReveal` Hook** (Owner: Elena, Est: 1h) - Verify performance and thread safety for scroll animations.

## 🚦 Readiness Assessment

-   **Testing:** 🟢 GREEN (100% Pass, Mobile Validated)
-   **Deployment:** 🟢 GREEN (Deployed/Ready)
-   **Stakeholder Acceptance:** 🟢 GREEN (Approved by Opsa)
-   **Technical Health:** 🟢 GREEN (Solid Foundation)

**Decision:** The team is **READY** to proceed to Epic 3 after completing the identified preparation tasks.
